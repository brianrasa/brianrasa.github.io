I recently completed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam, so my first post will be about the methodology I used in my preparations for the exam. There are tons of sites out there with specific questions and topics on the exam, most notably, [acloud.guru](www.acloud.guru)'s Ryan Kroonenberg. 

What did I use to prepare?
-the aforementioned acloud.guru site - specifically, Ryan's course of the same name of the exam
-hands-on - LOTS of hands-on. My assessment of the exam is this - if you've been working with AWS, administering it for around a year, that's the level of knowledge the test is designed for. More on that later...
-reading - LOTS of reading...White papers, FAQ's, other user's experiences for the test.

As mentioned, the test is designed for...well, a Solutions Architect tasked with building resilient, highly-available cloud deployments for organizations. As such, the exam is not something you should expect to walk into and pass without preparing, and preparing well. If you are NOT in the business of administering infrastructure, then expect to spend a good deal of your preparation behind the keyboard, testing different things in AWS. 

As for the reading, I hate to say it, but it does get down to quite specific details. For example, not only do you have to know what Elastic Block Storage (EBS), you need to know the specifics about creating a snapshot from one, and what is the best, most cost-effective strategy in snapshot retention.

Looking back on the exam, while I passed on my first attempt, I think I would have been served better to understand this level of detail that was required. I would have spent more time in the AWS services, testing out various scenarios. This would give you the answers you need, as you would be testing using real-life examples.

If you have committed to taking the exam, definitely do yourself a favor - roll your sleeves up and start jumping into the AWS console, with some guided help of course. Acloud.guru is a great place to get started.
